this is a learning project for me,
I'm learning to code in cpp by making a game called Tak.
Tak is a 3d board game, you can find the rules and explantion for the game at: https://ustak.org/play-beautiful-game-tak/

for now I'm still working at implamenting the rulles and logic of the game.
the next stage will be to better my understanding of GLFW and openGl in general
	all that while refactoring the code so it will make for a better api with my front end.
the last stage will be to packeg it all up and game a little.

p.s.
I do not have any licens for this game and have no plan of publishing and/or selling it as an executable.
I am starting to read "clean code" by Robert Martin, so my code will most likely slowly change in style as I progres in the next few months.
